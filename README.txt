hello i have just created a monopoly
how to play:
1. firstly you need to create server by typing "server" in client_or_server input
2. then start it one more time but with typing "client"
3. type server's address that was shown in servers console
4. write your name(any string)
5. enter your color for example 100,200,0
6. now your friend should write client and do puncts from 2 to 5
7. press roll for moving, buy for buying
8. if you got to some tile where you earn or pay money they will be given on the next turn(and thats my skill issue)
